    <h2>My Project</h2>
    <p>In year 10 semester 2 digi tech, we made games for people to play at the annual year 10 marekt day. My projet was THE CLAW! It was your typical arcade claw machine type game, except it wasn't rigged.</p>
    
    
   <span class="tag is-link">Chosing Digi Tech</span>
     <p>In semester 2, i chose digi because i didnt want to do dance. Mr Hullen gave me a choice of dancing in my dancing sqaure or doing this. I chose coding beacuse it may potentially give me some skills that i may use in my life.</p>
    
     <span class="tag is-link">Ideas</span>
    <p>My group was initally very behind on ideas. Everyone had picked what they were going to do, and yet we were still stuck. After many ridiculous ideas later, we settled on a claw machine.</p>
   
  <span class="tag is-link">Brainstorming</span>
  <p>Deciding how we would actually make the claw machine was a bit of a process. Basing off waht we had done the previous week, we knew there was a lego set that we could potentially make it out of.</p>
  
  <span class="tag is-link">Epro8 Build</span>
  <p>The first thing we were made to build, was a structure out of the epro8 materials. Mr Hullen said that the stands had to be big, and my group took it a bit out of context. We had this massive stand with a dangling claw at the top that was practically touching the roof. After making it smaller, the advertisment stand was finally finished, and we could move on to our advertisments.</p>
  
  <span class="tag is-link">Advertising</span>
  <p>After deciding on our group advertisment sign after 1 design idea, Mr Hullen asked us what our designs looked like. We explained that we only had one, so we continued to make 3 more that looked practically the same maybe with a different font or color. We also needed prices, and this took a while to figure out.</p>

  <span class="tag is-link">Building Our Claw</span>
  <p>With market day quickl approaching, and multiple absences, our claw production was put on hold. A few lessons by myself consisted of going to the skip and getting some cardboard, finding out it was too small, and then trailing back to the skip again. Soon enough Isha and Neve were back, and we could get onto the most stressful part. Coding.</p>

  <span class="tag is-link">Testing Our Claw</span>
  <p>The part that turned us all into emotional wrecks. We faced many problems during this process, mainly being that we just couldn't get it to work. Making one code that didn't work, to trying another that made it worse. Our final lesson, we still hadn't gotten it, and market day was tomorrow.</p>

  <span class="tag is-link">Market Day Set Up</span>
  <p>The most stressful time of all. With having little to no instruction on what we were supposed to do, and where we were supposed to be making it a whole lot worse. We set up our claw and had a wander around some of the other stalls before the rest of the school arrived. With our Claw Machine still not 100% working, all we could do was cross our fingers and hope for the best.</p>

  <span class="tag is-link">Market Day</span>
<p>Finally, the crowd of people rushed in. At first, no-one came to our stand because claw machines are sterotyped to be rigged. However ours was not, and after a few coustomers, people quickly realized that it wasn't and our business was on a roll. 1:00 came around, and we still had lollies left, so we began selling them for 50 cents to 1 dollar. That was a very successful decision, with all the lollies and chocolates gone by the end of lunch time. We made a total of around $50 dollars, and a good amount money to split between us, the market day had been a success.</p>

<span class="tag is-link">Reflection</span>
<p>Looking back on market day, our stand made a decent amount of money for all the time and effort we put into our build. I enjoyed the process, and have learnt alot from our mistakes. It was a bit stressful at times, and alot of things didnt go our way, but in the end it all turned out okay, and wasn't a complete disaster.</p>
